# StoryCraft

StoryCraft is a small project I created that enables you to create stories with multiple choices and endings, using Google Gemini. Tweak your story by choosing the genre, ending, length, and more.

## Development

This project was created using Svelte and Google Gemini API. To run the project, you need to have a Google AI Studio account created and a (free) API key to put in the `.env` file.

## Design

I used Tailwind 4.0 for the design of the project. The design is simple and clean, with a focus on the story and choices.

The project was made by Dominic Satnoianu. Use it as you wish, but please give credit where it's due :)
